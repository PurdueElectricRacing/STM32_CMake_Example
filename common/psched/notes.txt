PSched

Pre-emptive scheduling:
    Assign time for a task to run prior to running
    If higher priority task comes up at that time, we jump

Scheduling:
    Timer 2 interrupt as "OS" timer
        Determine next task to run
        Set ARR of timer 2 to elapse when next task needs to fire
    Yielding
        If task terminates execution prior to start of next task, context switch until background
        Use timer 2 interrupt to pull out of bg to fg
